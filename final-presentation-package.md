### Slide 4: Implementation [Code Editor Theme]
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Initialize system
system = CustomerSegmentationSystem()

# Define agents
data_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",
    goal="Clean and prepare data",
    backstory="Expert in data preprocessing"
)

segment_agent = Agent(
    role="Segmentation Specialist",
    goal="Perform customer clustering",
    backstory="Expert in ML clustering"
)

viz_agent = Agent(
    role="Visualization Expert",
    goal="Create insights dashboard",
    backstory="Data visualization specialist"
)

# Execute analysis
results = system.analyze("mall_customers.csv")
```
